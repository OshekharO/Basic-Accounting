                                    Understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for grasping the principles of accounting:
                                </p>
                                <h5>Key Foundational Concepts:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Double-Entry System:</strong> Records each transaction in at least two accounts, ensuring that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accounting Period:</strong> The time frame for which financial statements are prepared, typically a month, quarter, or year.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accrual Basis Accounting:</strong> Recognizes revenues when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cash Basis Accounting:</strong> Recognizes revenues when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Matching Principle:</strong> Expenses should be matched with the revenues they help to generate in the same accounting period.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Going Concern Assumption:</strong> Assumes that a business will continue to operate indefinitely and not be liquidated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consistency Principle:</strong> Consistent accounting methods should be used from period to period to ensure comparability.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Materiality:</strong> Information is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the decision of users of financial statements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prudence:</strong> Anticipate no profit and provide for all possible losses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Historical Cost Principle:</strong> Assets are recorded at their historical cost, which is the original cost of the asset at the time of acquisition.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Revenue Recognition Principle:</strong> Revenue is recognized when it is earned, not necessarily when cash is received.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Full Disclosure Principle:</strong> All relevant financial information should be disclosed in the financial statements or the accompanying notes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Objectivity Principle:</strong> Financial statements should be based on objective evidence and not on personal opinions or biases.</li>
                                </ul>
